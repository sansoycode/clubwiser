<h3>Where is Anytime Fitness Woolwich ?</h3>\
We are located on the ground floor of Tesco Extra in Woolwich Town centre, opposite Gordon Square and moments from Woolwich Arsenal station. There is free parking for members (and visitors) inside the Tesco building - using our registration kiosk inside the club.<br/>\
You can also jump onto one of the many buses heading toward Woolwich town centre.<br/>\

 <br/>\
<h3>What are the opening hours?</h3>\
We are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days per year! Please see our staffed times above for guest visits and tours.<br/>\
 <br/>\
<h3>Are there any joining offers available?</h3>\
Yes!<br/>\
We are currently offering fantastic savings. These are limited on a first come first serve basis and will be gone forever. Please contact us or drop by the gym to talk to us!<br/>\
<br/>There is a further 10% discount off your membership if you pay for the whole year upfront! Plus! - a further £1 off your membership for each friend you refer! <br/>\
Some members have even taken on the challenge to refer enough people to effectively earn a free membership!<br/>\
 <br/>\
<h3>How can I sign up?</h3>\
You can join us now via our online signup link: <a href="https://secure8.clubwise.com/woolwich/pos.asp">Click here</a><br/>\
You can also call us on 02037455055 or drop by our gym (inside Tesco Extra Woolwich) where our team would love to talk to you about your goals and get you set up.<br/>\
 <br/>\
<h3>How much will it cost to also have access to another club near my place of work?</h3>\
Nothing! With one membership, you can train at any of the 4,000 clubs globally, with 150 already in the UK and many in London (your nearest are Greenwich, Bexleyheath and Hither Green - with others in Aldgate, St Pauls, Waterloo, Kings Cross, Stratford and many more )<br/>\
 <br/>\
<h3>How much will it cost to take one or more classes?</h3>\
Nothing! Unlike your existing local clubs, all classes are free in our club - both instructor led and virtual, regardless of how many you attend. You can attend a class at any of the other 3600+ clubs globally at any time too so if you\'re on a business trip or a holiday, there\'s no reason to miss a workout!<br/>\
 <br/>\
<h3>Why aren\'t we cheaper than some budget gym chains?</h3>\
Anytime Fitness is not a budget operator - we invest a lot into ensuring we provide and maintain a great club at a competitive price. Unlike budget gyms, we limit the number of members who can join us. We do this to ensure our high end equipment is accessible to our members with minimal waiting times.<br/>\
<br/>Budget gyms typically have around 5 times more members than our clubs - meaning very busy peak times, long waits, and the poor condition equipment and bathrooms can often be left in. You may also find yourself paying extra for access to other branches and taking part in classes.<br/>\
Being one anonymous member out of thousands in a large budget gym may appeal to some, but at our clubs we like to get to know our members by name and offer a great alternative to those seeking more.<br/>\
<br/>We put a lot of resources into keeping the facilities in great condition, providing great staff and utilising the latest technology. Whether it\'s the option to work out at 2am with a virtual instructor, or ensuring air from within the gym is extracted and continuously replaced with scented fresh air from outside - our aim is to provide a club where you will enjoy working out, and ultimately achieve your fitness goals.<br/>\
<br/>Whilst budget gyms do operate at a budget price point, for people looking for budget quality, we think you\'ll agree our current promotional offer provides fantastic value for money.<br/>\
<br/>\
<h3>Do you offer a pay as you go scheme or rolling contract?</h3>\
We do not offer temporary membership arrangements at our clubs. We have a commitment to our existing members to provide a well maintained, friendly gym environment - full of familiar faces and other members who have also made long term commitments to their health and fitness.<br/>\
<br/>This means our equipment is in good working order and we can invest heavily in cleaning and maitainence as we know members are with us for a longer period of time. Budget operators with rolling contracts are seldom able to make a similar level of commitment to your workout experience.<br/>\
<br/>It is for this reason our memberships operate on a 12 month commitment basis, and our user reviews (which place us at the top spot of gyms in the area) reflect this.<br/>\
